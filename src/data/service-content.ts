        question: "What is the difference between a fractional CFO and a full time CFO?",
        answer: "A fractional CFO provides the same strategic financial leadership as a full time CFO but works with your business on a part time or project basis.

Think of it as the difference between knowing where you have been versus planning where you are going.",
